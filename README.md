# ABA-Project

## Course - Advanced Business Analytics:

## Team: Ashish Soni, Darshit Paresh Shah, Momtaj Anar Monni, Roland Schnee


## Goal : The task was to Predict whether a patient will survive the diagnosed liver cancer.
- Positives (1): Survives
- Negatives(0): Death


### Source of Data:  
Hepatocellular Carcinoma Dataset (HCC dataset), a Text file.

### Data Understanding: 
Every individual inspected the data and we came to the conclusions mentioned in the Final Project file.

### Data Preparation: 
Ashish and Roland were responsible for Data cleaning and implementing Data manipulation techniques to prepare the dataset for further analysis.

### Modelling: 
Every team member implemented 1 algorithm each, that includes Linear regression, Naive bayes, Decision Trees, Neural Networks.


### Evaluation: 
We got an accuracy of 77% with Naive bayes and the lowest number of False Negatives.
Since we do not want any person who has cancer to identified as someone who does not have cancer. 
We decided to present this approach.

Other algorithms also performed well in terms of accuracy but did not have a low number of false negatives.

### Results: 7 attributes are enough to classify the given instances.
Dataset is too small and has too many missing values, therefore achieving a better/perfect accuracy is difficult.
